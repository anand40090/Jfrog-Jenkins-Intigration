> In this repo, Jfrog has been integrated with Jenkins CI-CD pipeline

> we will be talking about How to Integrate JFrog Artifactory using Declarative Pipeline in Jenkins. 
> We will be having a pipeline created from scratch using a Jenkinsfile, and we will explain the whole syntax in each and every stage in this pipeline. 
> Also, in this pipeline we will create a .war file (web archive) and push that file to the JFrog artifactory.
